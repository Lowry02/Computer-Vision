## Project 1 — Camera Calibration

### Introduction

The **camera calibration problem** consists in estimating the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of a camera through several measurements.  
The outcome of these calculations is the **Perspective Projection Matrix** \( P \), which can be written as:

\[
P = K [R \mid t]
\]

Here:

- **\( K \)** is the intrinsic matrix, containing the internal parameters of the camera (specific to the camera itself), like the .  
- **\( R \)** and **\( t \)** are respectively the rotation matrix and the translation vector, describing the camera pose for a specific image relative to the **World Reference Frame**.
Once that these parameters are found, many computer vision tasks can be performed, such as **Triangulation**, **Structure from motion**, **Camera pose**, **Stereoscopy** and many other things that have become more and more popular and usefull nowadays.
